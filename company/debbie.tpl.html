       <p>
       I enrolled in the NASM Personal Trainer Certification Program with the goal

        of becoming a Personal Trainer. I am proud to say while studying and working full

        time I was able the pass the certification test on my first try and I am fully certified as a

        personal trainer.

           </p>
    <p>
        In addition I am an avid reader of nutritional health. My personal studies have touched

        on subjects that have improved my family's well-being by introducing healthier foods

        to our diet. I am also approached on a regular basis from friends, associates, and

        occasionally strangers for guidance on tips to a healthier diet and lifestyle. I look

        forward to sharing my nutritional tips with my clients.

    </p>
          <p>
        Now as an experienced personal trainer I am confident that my enthusiasm in this field,

        my years of working with my own trainer, a strong work ethic and respect for the human

        body make me an excellent candidate to be your personal trainer at Global Fitness.
