        <p>
            I was born in Clarksville, Tennessee to an immigrant father from Great Britain as he

            served our country in the military and a first generation mother who loved nothing better

            than to cook. After my father's stint in the US Army we joined my parents' families back

            in Central NY where I grew up.</p>


        <p>
            My father was a motor head who loved nothing better than his 1967 Corvette and of

            course his pride and joy; a restored Triumph Motorcycle. I guess I could have joined

            my mom in the kitchen, but I grew up a tom boy more interested in how fast and hard I

            could ride my dirt bike than the color of my lipstick.
