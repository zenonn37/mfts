       <p>

           I was born in Schenectady New york in 1963 and started training at my fathers Shoto kan karate studio at the age of 4.
           I received my first black belt at the age of 14. I then began training in Isshinryu Karate and
           Shōrin-ryū for several years and teaching karate at local youth centers until the age of 18.
           In college I had an opportunity to study Praying Mantis Kung-fu, Five Star Praying Mantis Kung-fu
           and Hungar Kung-fu. After college I trained at Willi Pep's boxing gym in Schenectady for ten years ,
           it was at this time that I developed my own system that incorporated everything I learned in karate and kung-fu and used in the boxing ring
           .For the past 14 years I have helped several professional mixed martial artists in kickboxing, boxing and strength training as well as train everyday people in most aspects of fitness, weight loss and body sculpting.
