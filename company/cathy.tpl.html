            A little about me, I am 42 years old, with 3 kids. I have been training myself for almost 20 years, and training others for a little over a year. I work with all levels of fitness ability. I especially love working with student athletes, but I also really enjoy working with overweight, or new to fitness adults.
            I work a variety of styles, ranging from Pilates inspired to Crossfit inspired. I especially enjoy HiiT, Tabata and weight training. I love using old school exercises and incorporating newer trends, like TRX.
            I believe in a total body workout, for functional or specific fitness.
            I currently am the Saratoga Central Catholic Varsity Baseball Strength and Conditioning Coach. I also train a variety of youth athletes three times per week. These kids range from elite level athlete to beginner to fitness. I am a gymnastics instructor for girls kindergarten through grade 6.
            I have taught many Bootcamp classes and personal train all different people from all walks of life.
