        I was born in Clarksville, Tennessee to an immigrant father from Great Britain as he

        served our country in the military and a first generation mother who loved nothing better

        than to cook. After my father's stint in the US Army we joined my parents' families back

        in Central NY where I grew up.</p>


        <p>
        My father was a motor head who loved nothing better than his 1967 Corvette and of

        course his pride and joy; a restored Triumph Motorcycle. I guess I could have joined

        my mom in the kitchen, but I grew up a tom boy more interested in how fast and hard I

        could ride my dirt bike than the color of my lipstick.

        From watching the Syracuse Chiefs AAA baseball games and the Syracuse Orange

        Basketball and Football games there was never time for boredom growing up in

        Syracuse. The Carrier Dome and War Memorial offered the greatest concertsâ€¦waiting

        in line 24 hours before Cheap Trick tickets went on sale was not out of the ordinary.

        However, watching sports and playing sports were entirely different things for me. Then

        one day in High School Gym class our instructor broke from the monotony of cross

        country running, playing hoops, or dodge ball and offered us girls a chance to work out

        on the weight lifting equipment. It was that day that I fell in love with fitness training and

        never looked back.

        As my kids got old enough for me to pursue a career, it was my passion in health

        and fitness that interested me in the medical field, while still wanting to maintain top

        physical form and concentrating on a healthy lifestyle. To that end I began working with

        a Personal Trainer and became fascinated with the methods by which I was able to

        achieve goals of fitness that I had never thought possible.
            </p>

    <p>
        Soon I was being approached by other members of my gym to help them to better

        utilize the gym equipment, assess their goals and develop their own workout routines.

        I found this to be very rewarding and made many close acquaintances along the way.

        Although I must admit that sitting behind a desk everyday answering phone calls,

        composing emails, following up with patients and doctors was becoming tedious and

        boring.

        </p>


       <p>
        As a result I enrolled in the NASM Personal Trainer Certification Program with the goal

        of becoming a Personal Trainer. I am proud to say while studying and working full

        time I was able the pass the certification test on my first try and I am fully certified as a

        personal trainer.

           </p>
    <p>
        In addition I am an avid reader of nutritional health. My personal studies have touched

        on subjects that have improved my family's well-being by introducing healthier foods

        to our diet. I am also approached on a regular basis from friends, associates, and

        occasionally strangers for guidance on tips to a healthier diet and lifestyle. I look

        forward to sharing my nutritional tips with my clients.

    </p>
          <p>
        Now as an experienced personal trainer I am confident that my enthusiasm in this field,

        my years of working with my own trainer, a strong work ethic and respect for the human

        body make me an excellent candidate to be your personal trainer at Global Fitness.
